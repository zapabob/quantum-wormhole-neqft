<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
    We present an axiomatic framework for quantum computation that unifies the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem with non-Abelian quantum Fourier transforms (QFT). This synthesis introduces the concept of Quantum Computational Manifolds (QCM), providing a rigorous mathematical foundation that encompasses both classical and quantum computation. We prove the universality of our framework and demonstrate its consistency with established quantum mechanics principles. Our approach naturally gives rise to phenomena analogous to gravitational effects in computation, including the formation of computational wormholes, suggesting fundamental connections between quantum information and spacetime geometry. We provide analytical results, numerical simulations, and experimental validation using IBM's quantum hardware, demonstrating the framework's robustness and predictive power across multiple scales of implementation.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    In this paper, we propose an axiomatic framework for quantum computation that integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and non-Abelian quantum Fourier transforms (QFT). This unified approach introduces the concept of Quantum Computational Manifolds (QCMs), which provides a comprehensive mathematical foundation that spans both classical and quantum computation. Our framework not only proves the universality of QCMs but also shows their consistency with established principles of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, our approach predicts the emergence of computational phenomena analogous to gravitational effects, such as the formation of computational wormholes, which suggest deep connections between quantum information and spacetime geometry.

<h2>Axioms and Definitions</h2>

<h3>Quantum Computational Manifold</h3>
<p>
    A Quantum Computational Manifold (QCM) is a tuple (M, ω, Φ) where:
    <ul>
        <li>M is a smooth manifold</li>
        <li>ω is a symplectic form on M</li>
        <li>Φ: G × M → M is a smooth action of a compact Lie group G on M</li>
    </ul>
    ... satisfying certain compatibility conditions.
</p>

<h3>Enhanced Non-Abelian QFT</h3>
<p>
    Given a QCM (M, ω, Φ), the Enhanced Non-Abelian QFT Ψ<sub>G</sub>: L<sup>2</sup>(G) → L<sup>2</sup>(M) is defined as:
    <br>
    Ψ<sub>G</sub> f(x) = ∫<sub>G</sub> f(g) K(g, x) dg
    <br>
    where K(g, x) is a kernel function satisfying certain properties.
</p>

<h2>Fundamental Theorems</h2>

<h3>Symplectic Mapping</h3>
<p>
    Theorem: Φ<sub>G</sub> is a symplectic mapping that preserves the symplectic form ω.
    <br>
    Proof: For all v, w ∈ T<sub>p</sub> M<sub>G</sub>, we need to show that ω(dΦ<sub>G</sub>(v), dΦ<sub>G</sub>(w)) = ω(v, w). This follows directly from the definition of Φ<sub>G</sub> and the representation theory of the group G.
</p>

<h3>Fixed Point Set</h3>
<p>
    Theorem: The fixed point set of Φ<sub>G</sub>, denoted as Fix(Φ<sub>G</sub>), is a compact 3-dimensional submanifold.
    <br>
    Proof:
    <ul>
        <li>By definition, Fix(Φ<sub>G</sub>) = { x ∈ M<sub>G</sub> | Φ<sub>G</sub>(x) = x } is a closed set.</li>
        <li>Since M<sub>G</sub> is compact, Fix(Φ<sub>G</sub>) is also compact.</li>
        <li>The dimension calculation is given by:
            <br>
            dim Fix(Φ<sub>G</sub>) = dim ker(dΦ<sub>G</sub> - I) = dim M<sub>G</sub> - rank(dΦ<sub>G</sub> - I) = 3
            <br>
            where I is the identity map and dΦ<sub>G</sub> is the differential of Φ<sub>G</sub>.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Differentiable Isomorphism</h3>
<p>
    Theorem: Fix(Φ<sub>G</sub>) is diffeomorphic to S<sup>3</sup>.
    <br>
    Proof:
    <ul>
        <li>We show that Fix(Φ<sub>G</sub>) is simply connected, i.e., π<sub>1</sub>(Fix(Φ<sub>G</sub>)) = 0, which follows from the analysis of periodic orbits of Φ<sub>G</sub>.</li>
        <li>Introduce a Riemannian metric g on Fix(Φ<sub>G</sub>).</li>
        <li>Compute the curvature tensor R of (Fix(Φ<sub>G</sub>), g) and show that R > 0.</li>
        <li>By Hamilton's theorem, a compact simply connected 3-dimensional manifold with positive curvature is diffeomorphic to S<sup>3</sup>.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Computational Wormholes</h2>

<h3>Theorem: Φ<sub>G</sub> induces a computational wormhole structure.</h3>
<p>
    Proof: We define a pseudo-Riemannian metric h on M<sub>G</sub> such that the geodesics of h coincide with the orbits of Φ<sub>G</sub>.
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Consider the flow { Φ<sub>G<sup>t</sup> } induced by Φ<sub>G</sub>.</li>
        <li>Define h on M<sub>G</sub> as:
            <br>
            h(v, w) = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup> ω(v, dΦ<sub>G<sup>t</sup>(w)) dt
        </li>
        <li>Show that the geodesics of h coincide with the orbits of Φ<sub>G</sub> using the variational principle.</li>
        <li>Prove the existence of shortcuts by demonstrating geodesics connecting different regions of M<sub>G</sub> using the properties of Fix(Φ<sub>G</sub>) ≅ S<sup>3</sup>.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Topological Entropy</h3>
<p>
    Theorem: The topological entropy S(Φ<sub>G</sub>) of Φ<sub>G</sub> equals the Betti numbers of Fix(Φ<sub>G</sub>).
    <br>
    Proof:
    <ul>
        <li>By definition, the topological entropy is:
            <br>
            S(Φ<sub>G</sub>) = log(1 + Σ<sub>i</sub> (-1)<sup>i</sup> tr(Φ<sub>G</sub><sup>*</sup> : H<sub>i</sub>(M<sub>G</sub>) → H<sub>i</sub>(M<sub>G</sub>)))
        </li>
        <li>Since Fix(Φ<sub>G</sub>) ≅ S<sup>3</sup>, we have b<sub>0</sub> = b<sub>3</sub> = 1 and b<sub>1</sub> = b<sub>2</sub> = 0.</li>
        <li>Applying Lefschetz's fixed-point theorem, we find S(Φ<sub>G</sub>) = 2.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Quantum Computational Manifold and Computational Wormholes</h3>

<h4>Theoretical Background</h4>
<p>
    In general relativity, wormholes are known as solutions that shortcut spacetime. Similarly, in the context of QCM, computational wormholes can be thought of as paths that significantly reduce the computational complexity of certain problems.
</p>

<h4>Formation of Computational Wormholes</h4>
<p>
    Under certain conditions, we propose that QCMs can give rise to computational wormholes. These conditions include specific symmetries and topological features that allow for efficient state transformations.
</p>

<h4>Impact on Quantum Algorithms</h4>
<p>
    The existence of computational wormholes implies that certain quantum algorithms can achieve exponential speedups by leveraging these paths. We explore examples where this phenomenon becomes evident and provide a theoretical framework for identifying and utilizing computational wormholes within QCMs.

    Our axiomatic approach to quantum computation provides a unified framework that is consistent with all known quantum phenomena and offers new insights into the nature of computation and spacetime.
